# Debug as Webpage:
- its easier to debug this tool as a normal webpage. the console behavior is much better.
- open `index.html` in browser and open the developer tools console
- limits: cannot debug storage settings here though...

# Debug as AddOn:
- open browser console with `ctrl` + `shift` + `j`
- click gear, click `Show Content Messages`
- see logs!
